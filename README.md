# Leave Management System
This Angular project is a user interface for our leave management system, which can be found here https://github.com/BlankDesu13/leave-management.git. This project allows users to manage their leave
requests, view their leave balances, and track the status of their leave applications.

## Development server

To run the development server, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the command `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
4. Run the command `ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json` to start the development server.

   any changes to the source files.
